## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB (local or remote)

### Getting Started

1. **Download the repository**:

   You can download or copy the project files to your local machine.

     cd client
     npm install
     ```

4. **Configure environment variables**:

   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following variables:

   ```plaintext
MONGO_URL = mongodb+srv://govindnikhil508:6JXzdTVYP0nfW0kq@cluster0.trpwv.mongodb.net/
JWT_SECRET = 794fhewnjrunfddbwREWQECEC
PORT = 5000
